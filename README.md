# Research-Project
All code were run on Python except for the sample selection, which was carried out in Rstudio.
Each folder contained the input data files and code needed for each step. The 'bioacoustic_classifier_model.ipynb' is the jupyter notebook for my logistic regression and random forest classifier. The evaluation results of all models were also uploaded here as 'all_model_results.txt'.
